### The 12 Labours of Hercules

#Owned by: Glorianne Villanueva


Context: I am very invested in greek mythology, and I just enjoy talking about it a lot. I'm also a member of the mythology club, so I wanted to make this as a review, in case we ever go over the 12 Labours of Hercules, because it's easy to mix them up. I _love_ talking about this, so I didn't copy and paste anything. ^-^
