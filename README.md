### Information

**Shadow** is a five-year-old Shih Tzu. He's the runt of his pack, but he is loved by us regardless. He is the half-brother of our previous dog, T-Bone, who passed away.

### About him

All of the commands he knows were taught unintentionally, with the exception of: "sit"

He's a silly little dog, usually in a silly little goofy mood, and either starts hiding under tables or tries to look as cute as possible whenever he hears "ligo" or "vet"

He will jump on any sleeping person to wake them up whenever my mother says to wake them up.

He has a sixth sense and knows when we are secretly eating wothout him.

The best way to summon him is by laughing. He will assume that you are having fun without him, and will run to your location. 
You can also summon him by performing a special r̶̪͒i̶̬̒t̵̠̓u̶̞̾a̵̺͛l̸̮̽.
